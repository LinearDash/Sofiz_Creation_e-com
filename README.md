    "routes": [
      { "handle": "filesystem" },
      { "src": "/.*", "dest": "/index.html" }
    ]
  }
  ```
- Set environment variables (e.g., `VITE_API_URL`) in the Vercel dashboard to point to your backend deployment.

### Backend

    ],
    "routes": [
      { "src": "/(.*)", "dest": "index.js" }
